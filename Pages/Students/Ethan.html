<body> 
    <p>My name is Ethan, and for the past few years I've wanted a husky. There are a variety of reasons why. </p>
    <ol> 
        <list> They'd likely do quite well in cold michigan weather </list>
        <list> They are big, but not obnoxiously big, making them a nearly perfect size </list>
        <list> Their unique blue eyes has a cute look other dog breeds just don't have (no offense to those breeds)</list>
        <list> Their cleverness could prove to be quite fun if you ever wished to play a game with one </list>
    </ol>
