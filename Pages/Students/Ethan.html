<body> 
    <p>My name is Ethan, and for the past few years I've wanted a husky. There are a variety of reasons why. </p>
    <ol> 
        <li> They'd likely do quite well in cold michigan weather </li>
        <li> They are big, but not obnoxiously big, making them a nearly perfect size </li>
        <li> Their unique blue eyes has a cute look other dog breeds just don't have (no offense to those breeds)</li>
        <li> Their cleverness could prove to be quite fun if you ever wished to play a game with one </li>
    </ol>
<p> To support my reasoning, here is a good husky boy. </p>
